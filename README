A Kanban board.

- uses AJAX and a persistent sqlite database to maintain state

TODO:
• Use Tumblr as a platform for the kanban board
• Use the html text editor to create the board, and possibly use javascript
    • Add the javascript either manually or possibly host via tumblr as well
• Ideas:
    • Use one post to house the kanban board
        • Adding or modifying an event will both update the board and create a new
          post
            • The new post will basically be change history
        • Find a way to make the board post always visible
            • Hide posts with a certain tag
    • Or use posts with multiple columns (prefer this idea)
(NO)    • front page redirect to kanban tag
(DONE)  • 4 cols (Done is just archive)
(DONE)      • probably can filter columns with tags
(DONE)      • TagsAsClasses
(DONE)      • use JS and appendChild to move posts to proper column
(DONE)          • Check {URL} to not render the board on the main page
(DONE)      • Nice looking headings
(NO)    • Use the way to hide posts
(NO)    • Use tag to show all posts (bypass post limit on homepage)
        • Edit posts using url method (get url of post, then replace post with
          edit, then remove title from end)
            • BUT HOW TO ADD
                • idea: use iframe
                • OR: use Tumblr api (needs key)
